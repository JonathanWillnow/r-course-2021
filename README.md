<!-- ABOUT THE COURSE -->
## About The Course

On this page we provide all materials for the *Introductory R Course*.
The course starts on the 06.04.2021 (Tuesday) and goes until the 09.04.2021 (Friday).

### Lecture notes

The lecture notes can be found in the folder `lecture-notes` and a nicely rendered version is available here: [online script](https://josefnagelschmidt.github.io/r-course-2021/).

### Live coding scripts

All scripts that will be written during the live coding will be available in the folder `live-coding-lecture-scripts`.

### Exercises

Solutions to the exercises will be found in the folder `.exercises`, in which we also store the data which is needed to solve the exercises. As of right now we cannot upload the exercises on Github due to copyright issues. However, you can access those with the password provided at the start of the course at [exercises](https://uni-bonn.sciebo.de/s/aJqdU36DZ5vgBzu).

### Outlook

On Friday and, if time permits, I will present on what's possible with R in a small outlook.
